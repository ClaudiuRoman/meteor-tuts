<h1>Hello!</h1>

We are Cult of Coders, a young company focused on Meteor. We absolutely love it, and we only work with it.

In the past years we gathered a lot of experience, Meteor has changed a lot, but it is now fully packed with lots
of cool stuff that will help you create from the most simple apps to complex enterprise-level applications.

Our tutorials will be structured in chapters. Each chapter will have different lessons.

We encourage you to put in practice everything you learn. This way you will remember it better in the future.

<h1>Before you begin</h1>

This tutorial is focused on Meteor. We need to keep our concerns separated, this is why, it will assume that you already have
a JavaScript ES6 foundation.

If you are not familiar with JavaScript at all:
